# Problem Statement : UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING FOR CUSTOMER MARKET SEGMENTATION.
Considering I am working in a bank as data scientist and provided with extensive data of the bank 's customers for past 6 months.
The bank marketing team would like to leverage AI/ML to launch a targeted marketing ad campaign that is tailored to specific group of customers.
(Problem taken from Coursera)
We are dividing customers in 4 groups:
1) Transactors - Customers who pay least amount of interest charges and careful with there money.
2) Revolvers - Customers who use credit card as kind of a loan.This group is lucrative to bank as they pay 20% interest charges.
3) VIP/Prime - Customers with high credit limit, more chances of full payment.
4) New customers - New customers of low tenure, which can be targetted to enroll for new bank services .(eg: travel credit cards)
